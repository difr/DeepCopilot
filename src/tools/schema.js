// OpenAI function-calling schema for tools exposed to DeepSeek.
//
// Design notes (v0.24.0):
//   - Every tool description starts with "Use ONLY when ..." or carries
//     a similar negative constraint. DeepSeek's function-calling RLHF
//     biases toward eager tool use; the constraint pushes the prior down.
//   - Order matters. LLMs have a slight position bias when picking from
//     a tool list; action/edit tools come FIRST so reading is not the
//     default reach. Reading and listing come LAST.
//   - update_plan is a UI sidebar updater, kept at the end.
